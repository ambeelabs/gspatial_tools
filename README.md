2. Filter points based on radius

3. Bulk Clip and Save Raster Files

4. Reproject Raster Files

5. Stitch Multiple Raster Files in same CRS

6. Read Raster File directly to GeoDataFrame

7. Convert Xarray to GeoDataFrame

8. Clip each geometry by rectangle/bbox

9. Sample points inside polygons

10. Sample points inside bbox

11. Sample points data from raster without loading the entire dataset

12. Get K nearest points along with distance and indices for each point in a GeoDataFrame

13. Move and Scale a polygon/shape from a GeoDataFrame
